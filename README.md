# Sunrise and Sunset Tracker :sunny:

## Description

Imagine having the beauty of sunrise and sunset captured effortlessly in a single app. Introducing our Sunrise and Sunset Tracker project, where nature's most captivating moments are just a tap away. Whether you're an avid photographer, nature enthusiast, or someone seeking a moment of daily tranquility, our app provides real-time information on sunrise and sunset times, along with stunning visuals, weather updates, and location-specific details. Elevate your mornings and evenings with our app – where every day begins and ends with the breathtaking beauty of the sky.

This application allows the user to access sunset and sunrise data as well as targeted latitude and longitude data via API’s, additionally using a suggestive API to allow the user to view precise geographical data.

The motivation behind this project includes initially finding inspiration in travel API’s - in the sense that this combination of API’s would have a good chance of working together successfully.
